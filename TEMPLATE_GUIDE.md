# Template Author Guide

Use this guide when creating or updating templates for **bunkerweb-templates**. Following these expectations keeps every template clear, consistent, and easy to maintain.

## Template Essentials

Each template lives under `templates/<template-name>/` and should contain:

- `template.json`: The BunkerWeb template definition that declares the template `id`, user-facing `name`, and any referenced settings, configs, or steps.
- `configs/`: Optional directory holding NGINX fragments referenced in `template.json`.
- Additional assets: Optional files such as helper scripts or a short `README.md` to provide service-specific notes.

Name templates descriptively (for example `wordpress`, `nextcloud`, `synapse`, `base-hardening`). Because templates behave the same across Docker, Kubernetes, bare metal, and other integrations, keep everything directly under `templates/` instead of nesting by environment.

> ℹ️ For a deeper explanation of how BunkerWeb consumes templates (including the built-in `low`, `medium`, and `high` presets), see the [official templates concept documentation](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/latest/concepts/#templates).

### `template.json` essentials

Every `template.json` must follow the structure expected by BunkerWeb:

| Property   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | string | Yes      | Stable identifier for the template; keep it unique and aligned with the directory name.             |
| `name`     | string | Yes      | User-facing label shown in the UI; keep it concise and descriptive.                                  |
| `settings` | object | No       | Key/value pairs of multisite settings that override defaults when the template is applied.           |
| `configs`  | array  | No       | Paths relative to `configs/` for NGINX configuration snippets that should be included.                |
| `steps`    | array  | No       | Ordered steps that group related settings and configs for easy-mode guidance.                        |

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "wordpress",
  "name": "WordPress",
  "settings": {
    "SERVER_NAME": "www.example.com",
    "REVERSE_PROXY_HOST": "http://mywp",
    "MAX_CLIENT_SIZE": "50m",
    "MODSECURITY_CRS_PLUGINS": "wordpress-rule-exclusions"
  },
  "configs": [
    "modsec/wordpress_false_positives.conf"
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Domains and TLS",
      "subtitle": "Point the template at your WordPress hostname(s).",
      "settings": [
        "SERVER_NAME"
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Reverse proxy",
      "subtitle": "Tell BunkerWeb where your WordPress upstream lives.",
      "settings": [
        "REVERSE_PROXY_HOST",
        "MAX_CLIENT_SIZE",
        "MODSECURITY_CRS_PLUGINS"
      ],
      "configs": [
        "modsec/wordpress_false_positives.conf"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ID

- Use a lowercase, hyphenated slug that stays consistent between releases (for example `wordpress` or `nextcloud-hardening`).
- Keep the `id` synchronized with the directory name so users can map files to their template references easily.
- Treat the `id` as immutable once a template is published; consumers rely on it to detect updates.

#### Settings

- Only multisite settings are supported. Use the keys exactly as BunkerWeb expects them (e.g. `SERVER_NAME`, `USE_PROXY_CACHE`).
- Provide sensible defaults, knowing that users can still adjust them after importing the template.

#### Configs

- Point to files relative to the template's `configs/` directory (for example `modsec/false_positives.conf`).
- Organize snippets under a supported BunkerWeb configuration type such as `modsec/`, `modsec-crs/`, or `server-http/`.

#### Steps

- Steps are optional but recommended for multi-stage setups.
- Each step may reference settings and configs that appear elsewhere in the template. Doing so lets the easy-mode UI expose those items to the user for tweaking.
- Titles and subtitles should be concise instructions (for example “Adjust domains”, “Review hardening rules”).

### Template extras

While not required by BunkerWeb, consider adding:

- `README.md`: Brief context about the service, prerequisites, and customization tips.
- `.env.example` or helper scripts: Only when they simplify recreating the service locally.
- Screenshot or diagram references when they improve understanding (keep assets lightweight).

### Distribution options

Use the repository's [installation guide](README.md#installing-templates) for both supported delivery methods:

1. **Web UI Raw import (recommended)** – Upload or paste `template.json`, upload every missing custom config when prompted, save, then select the template for a service.
2. **Plugin bundle** – Copy `template.json` to `<plugin>/templates/<name>.json` and copy `configs/` to `<plugin>/templates/<name>/configs/` before installing or reloading the plugin.

The repository and plugin layouts differ, so preserve the structure documented in the installation guide rather than copying the source directory unchanged.

- Advanced configuration examples: [docs.bunkerweb.io/advanced](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/latest/advanced)

## Formatting Guidelines

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Install `pre-commit`, run `pre-commit install`, and execute `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing so the shared formatting (Prettier, Codespell, Gitleaks) is applied consistently.
- **Directory names**: Lowercase, words separated by hyphens.
- **JSON**: Two spaces for indentation, double quotes for keys and strings, trailing commas avoided.
- **NGINX snippets**: Keep indentation consistent; add short comments when behavior is non-obvious.
- **Markdown**: Wrap commands in backticks, keep lines under ~100 characters, use fenced code blocks for multi-line content.
- **Filenames**: Stick to ASCII characters and avoid spaces.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Document which tooling or platforms you used while testing (e.g. Docker Compose 2.17, Kubernetes 1.29) so users know what you validated, but avoid duplicating files unless truly required.
- Reference official documentation for service-specific configuration defaults so users understand why a value matters.
- Validate JSON before submitting (`jq . template.json`) and lint NGINX snippets locally where possible.
- Keep secrets and credentials out of the repository. Use placeholders and explain where real values belong.
- Prefer declarative configuration over shell scripts; if a script is required, explain why in the template README.
- Log every change in `CHANGELOG.md` by adding a bullet under `## Unreleased` using the format `- [@github-handle] What changed`. This keeps manual releases accurate and makes it easy to track ownership.

## Licensing Reminder

All templates and documentation must comply with the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)**. Only submit content you can license under GPL-3.0, and ensure any third-party snippets are compatible.
