# Pi-hole Template

This template reverse-proxies the Pi-hole **web admin UI and REST API** through
BunkerWeb. Pi-hole's DNS service is out of scope: keep serving DNS directly from
Pi-hole on port 53 and only front the HTTP interface with BunkerWeb.

## Setup

1. Follow the repository's [installation guide](../../README.md#installing-templates)
   for the web UI or plugin bundle method.
2. Assign the template to the Pi-hole service (`USE_TEMPLATE=pi-hole` or select
   it in the easy-mode UI).
3. Replace the example domain and upstream with your Pi-hole deployment, then
   review the real-IP settings described below.
4. Reload BunkerWeb and verify the admin UI and REST API through the proxy.

## Security tuning notes

This template deliberately relaxes a few defaults so a self-hosted Pi-hole admin
does not get locked out of their own dashboard. Each is safe to tighten once your
environment allows it:

- **`USE_DNSBL=no`** — administrators often connect from residential IPs that
  appear on public DNS blocklists, and leaving DNSBL on can lock you out of your
  own panel. Re-enable it if your admin IPs are static and known to be clean.
- **`BAD_BEHAVIOR_THRESHOLD=20`, `BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_TIME=3600`, and 401 left out of
  `BAD_BEHAVIOR_STATUS_CODES`** — the admin UI legitimately produces bursts of
  404/403 responses while you navigate it, and failed logins (401) are already
  rate-limited elsewhere, so they are not counted here. The one-hour ban keeps a
  genuine bad actor out without causing long self-lockouts on a fat-fingered day.
- **`LIMIT_REQ_RATE=20r/s`** — the admin dashboard polls its own API several times
  a second, so a lower rate would throttle normal use.
- **`USE_METRICS=no`** — metrics are disabled to keep small instances light.
  Re-enable it if you want BunkerWeb's metrics page.

## Cloudflare real IP assumption

`REAL_IP_FROM` and `REAL_IP_HEADER` default to Cloudflare's IP ranges and the
`CF-Connecting-IP` header, assuming Pi-hole sits behind Cloudflare. If you are
**not** behind Cloudflare, edit `REAL_IP_FROM`/`REAL_IP_HEADER` to match your own
proxy or set `USE_REAL_IP=no`, otherwise client IPs will be mis-attributed.

## Root Domain Caveat

It is possible to serve Pi-hole at the root of your domain, but this adds an
extra attack surface and is **not advised**. Additionally, you will always be
redirected to `/admin/` — this is how Pi-hole is built and cannot be changed;
using BunkerWeb, you would need to modify Pi-hole itself to achieve otherwise.

If you still want to proceed, use the raw config below instead of the
`template.json`.

## Validation

- Run `jq . template.json` to confirm the template definition is valid JSON.
- Sign in to the admin UI and exercise its API-backed dashboard through
  BunkerWeb to confirm routing, client IP attribution, and rate limits.
