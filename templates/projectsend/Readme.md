# Projectsend Template

## Overview

This template proxies Projectsend through BunkerWeb with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates, reverse proxying, a 8192m request size limit and custom configuration files.

## Prerequisites

- A running Projectsend server that BunkerWeb can reach.
- A public hostname pointing to BunkerWeb.
- Access to the BunkerWeb web UI or service environment variables.

## Setup

1. Import `template.json` (Templates → **Create new template** → **Raw**, then upload or paste it).
2. When the **Missing Custom Configs** dialog appears, upload every file listed in the [Custom configs](#custom-configs) section from `configs/`, then save.
3. Assign `USE_TEMPLATE=projectsend` to the service, or select **Projectsend** in the web UI.
4. Replace `SERVER_NAME`, `EMAIL_LETS_ENCRYPT` and `REVERSE_PROXY_HOST` with values for your deployment.
5. Reload BunkerWeb, open the public URL, and test sign-in and the main workflow of the application (for example a document, upload or API call).

## Placeholders

The values below are examples. Replace them with your own before using the template:

- `example.com` → your own domain name
- `admin@example.com` → your own email address
- `http://projectsend:80` → the name of the service's container on the shared Docker network, or its IP address and port, for example `http://10.0.0.5:8080`
- `replace-with-your-crowdsec-api-key` → the API key generated in CrowdSec (for example with `cscli bouncers add <name>`)
- `example-user` → your own username
- `openssl rand -hex 24` → generates a long random secret for each variable
- the example addresses `192.0.2.x`, `198.51.100.x` and `203.0.113.x` → the IP addresses or ranges that should be allowed

## Notes

- **Certificates:** the HTTP challenge needs port 80 on BunkerWeb to be reachable from the internet for every domain in `SERVER_NAME`.
- **Upstream:** `http://projectsend:80` is a container name and port. It only resolves when BunkerWeb and the application share a Docker network (the Compose example joins the external `bw-services` network with the alias `projectsend`; attach BunkerWeb to the same network); otherwise replace it with the IP address and port of the service, for example `http://10.0.0.5:8080`.
- **Uploads:** `MAX_CLIENT_SIZE=8192m` limits each request, not the total size of a file sent by a chunked client. Raise it only if clients need larger single requests.
- **Methods:** only the listed HTTP methods are accepted; anything else is rejected before reaching the application.
- **Custom configs (`modsec-crs`):** ModSecurity rules loaded before the OWASP Core Rule Set (typically rule exclusions / false-positive fixes).
- **CrowdSec:** `127.0.0.1` points to the BunkerWeb container itself. If CrowdSec runs in another container or on another host, use its container name or IP address in `CROWDSEC_API` and `CROWDSEC_APPSEC_URL`.
- **Anti-bot:** `ANTIBOT_IGNORE_URI` (`^/build/ ^/api/ ^/share/ ^/uploads ^/zip-downloads`) skips the challenge for those paths because API clients cannot solve it. Those paths are protected only by the application and the other security features.
- **Allowlist:** the addresses in the allowlist are documentation examples. Replace them with the IP addresses or ranges that may bypass the security checks.

## Docker Compose example

Usernames and passwords below are placeholders. Replace them with your own values before deploying.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: projectsend/projectsend:latest
    container_name: projectsend-app
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9999:80"                                # Maps host port 8080 to container port 80
    environment:
      # -- App --
      APP_URL: "https://filo.example.com"     # ASSUMPTION: pick the real hostname (matches SERVER_NAME below)
      TZ: "Europe/Berlin"

      # -- Tells ProjectSend a reverse proxy (BunkerWeb) sits in front. --
      # Safe as "*" here because only BunkerWeb can reach this container's
      # port on the bw-services network below — nobody else can connect
      # directly and spoof X-Forwarded-For.
      TRUSTED_PROXIES: "*"

      # -- Database --
      DB_HOST: "db"
      DB_NAME: "projectsend"
      DB_USER: "example-user"
      DB_PASSWORD: "${DB_PASSWORD:?Set DB_PASSWORD}"
      DB_ROOT_PASSWORD: "${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD:?Set DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}"

      # -- Redis (sessions, cache, queue) --
      REDIS_HOST: "redis"
    volumes:
      # Bind-mounted per the persistence doc: this ONE mount carries both
      # the uploaded files AND storage/.env (APP_KEY). Do not mount just
      # storage/app/files/ — that leaves APP_KEY inside the container.
      - ./projectsend-default.conf:/etc/nginx/http.d/default.conf:ro
      - /srv/projectsend/storage:/var/www/html/storage
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    networks:
      default:
      bw-services:
        aliases:
          - projectsend

  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: projectsend-db
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:?Set MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}"
      MYSQL_DATABASE: "projectsend"
      MYSQL_USER: "example-user"
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: "${MYSQL_PASSWORD:?Set MYSQL_PASSWORD}"
    volumes:
      - /srv/projectsend/mysql:/var/lib/mysql

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: projectsend-redis
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  bw-services:
    external: true
```

Set the required environment variables before starting the stack:

```bash
export DB_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
export DB_ROOT_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
export MYSQL_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
docker compose config
docker compose up -d
```

## Validation

Before importing the template:

```bash
jq . template.json
jq -e --arg expected "$(basename "$PWD")" '.id == $expected' template.json
jq -e '(.settings | keys | sort) == ([.steps[] | .settings[]] | sort)' template.json
for f in $(jq -r '.configs[]' template.json); do test -f "configs/$f" || echo "missing: $f"; done
```

After applying it:

- Confirm the BunkerWeb scheduler reload completes without a template or unknown-setting error.
- Sign in and test the main workflow of the application (for example an upload, download or API call).
- Check BunkerWeb logs for rate-limit, bad-behavior, and ModSecurity events before changing security controls.


## Additional information
For uploads above 9MB you'll need to remove ```env CROWDSEC_APPSEC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7422/ ``` along with increasing the `MAX_CLIENT_SIZE` but that is on your own risk and you should know what you do.
